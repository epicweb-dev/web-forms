# Encryption Seed

👨‍💼 So, you may not have noticed this, but `remix-utils` doesn't actually put the
real date the form was generated in the `validFrom` input of the form. It's just
some random string of characters. Well, it's not really random, it's actually
encrypted. The reason for this is because we don't want bots to be able to just
change the date on the form and then submit it quickly. So `remix-utils` will
encrypt the actual valid date and that's what the form is set to.

To be able to decrypt the value, we need an encryption key. `remix-utils` will
generate one for us if we don't set one ourselves. Unfortunately, there's a
problem with doing things this way. The key is generated at startup time, so if
you restart your server, or your running multiple instances of your app, a form
could be generated with one key and validated with another.

So instead, we can set it to something consistent across all instances of our
app. We can do this by setting the `encryptionSeed` option in our config. The
tricky bit is we need this to be secret, so we're not going to just commit this
to the repository. We need this to be kept secret. So we'll use environment
variables.

So we're going to place it in our `.gitignore`d `.env` file which we're loading
at startup time during development, and then you'll want to make sure to set
this environment variable in your production environment as well
([for example](https://fly.io/docs/reference/secrets/)).

🐨 So first, you'll set the variable in <InlineFile file=".env" />, then
go to <InlineFile file="app/utils/env.server.ts" /> to validate at startup time
that the variable is set (and get type safety on it as well).

🐨 Once you've got that, you can set the `encryptionSeed` in the honeypot config.
