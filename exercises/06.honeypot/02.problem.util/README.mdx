# Remix Utils

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/professional-web-forms/honeypot/honeypot-protection-with-remix-utils" />

üë®‚Äçüíº We're going to use [`remix-utils`](https://npm.im/remix-utils) to put
together the honeypot in the UI and check it in our `action`. This is going to
require a bit of setup because it can do more than just handle the single field
for us.

First you're going to need to
create <InlineFile file="app/utils/honeypot.server.ts" /> to create a honeypot
instance. For example:

```tsx nocopy
import { Honeypot } from 'remix-utils/honeypot/server'

export const honeypot = new Honeypot({
	validFromFieldName: 'validFrom',
	encryptionSeed: process.env.HONEY_POT_ENCRYPTION_SEED,
	nameFieldName: 'name',
	randomizeNameFieldName: true,
})
```

We don't need all those options just yet though. In fact, for this first bit, we
just want to set `validFromFieldName` to `null` for now. We'll get to the rest
of the options later.

Once you have that set up, you can use it in the
`action` of <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/signup.tsx" />. For example:

```tsx nocopy
try {
	honeypot.check(formData)
} catch (error) {
	if (error instanceof SpamError) {
		throw new Response('Form not submitted properly', { status: 400 })
	}
	throw error
}
```

The `SpamError` comes from `remix-utils/honeypot/server`.

And then for the UI, you can replace our custom `input` stuff with
`<HoneypotInputs />` from `remix-utils/honeypot/react`.

Good luck!
