# Validation aria attributes

üë®‚Äçüíº Have you heard the first rule of ARIA? Don't use ARIA. If you can use native
HTML, do it. If you can't, then use ARIA.

That's the case for our error messages. So, we need to add `aria-invalid="true"`
and `aria-describedby="error-id"` to the input if there is an error. Otherwise,
those attributes should not appear (so you'll set them to `undefined` in that
case). So when the `title` looks good, it should render HTML like this:

```html
<div>
	<label class="..." for="note-title">Title</label>
	<input
		class="..."
		id="note-title"
		name="title"
		required=""
		maxlength="100"
		value="Basic Koala Facts"
	/>
	<div class="..."></div>
</div>
```

And when the `title` has an error, it should render HTML like this:

```html lines=10,11
<div>
	<label class="..." for="note-title">Title</label>
	<input
		class="..."
		id="note-title"
		name="title"
		required=""
		maxlength="100"
		value="Basic Koala Facts"
		aria-invalid="true"
		aria-describedby="title-error"
	/>
	<div class="...">
		<ul id="title-error" class="...">
			<li class="...">Title must be at least 1 character</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>
```

Note that `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` are not present unless there is
an error. To accomplish this, you can pass `undefined` as their values if there
is no error, for example:

```tsx
<input
	aria-invalid={hasErrors || undefined}
	aria-describedby={hasErrors ? 'id' : undefined}
/>
```

The emoji will give you some tips on creating variables to make this easier.

ü¶â Another thing you may notice is in both cases we're rendering the `div`
responsible for rendering the error messages. This to ensure the UI doesn't
bounce around when an error shows up.

And we do this for more than just the `input`, we'll want this for the `<form>`
as well. Let's jump in!

<callout-info class="aside">
	Note that there is also `aria-errormessage`, however screen reader support is
	unfortunately very poor for that attribute. We just need to do the best we
	can.
</callout-info>

<callout-warning>
	We don't currently have any form-level errors, but we're going to put this in
	place anyway for learning purposes. Eventually we'll have some errors like
	that.
</callout-warning>
