# Accessibility

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/professional-web-forms/accessibility/intro-to-accessibility" />

I'm not going to beat around the bush. It's a lot of work to make a web
application fully accessible to all users. However failure to do so can lead to
an extremely poor user experience for a segment of your users that are already
at a disadvantage. Additionally, you could find yourself in the middle of a
lawsuit if you don't make your web application accessible. So this is an
extremely important subject that deserves more of your attention than a single
exercise in a web app fundamentals workshop.

## The web

The web platform has been meticulously designed to maximize accessibility for a
diverse range of users. This includes addressing the needs of those with visual,
auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. A multitude of features have been
implemented, such as keyboard navigation,
[screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) compatibility, and
voice command support.

Moreover, the platform offers extensive customization options, enabling users to
tailor the appearance, text size, contrast, color, font, layout, and animation
of a web page to their preferences.

Your job is to make it so the browser can employ these technologies to provide a
great experience for all users. So while many accessibility concerns involve
design and word choice, in your role as a web developer, a lot of your time will
be spent ensuring your forms, links, and other interactive elements are properly
labeled and structured.

One example of this is properly labeling your form elements so the browser knows
which labels are associated to which form elements. This is important because
screen readers will read out the label when the user focuses on the form
element. If the label is not properly associated, you don't have any guarantees.
There are a few ways to associate a label and a form element. A common way to do
this is through the `for` and `id` attributes.

```html
<form>
	<label for="name">Name</label>
	<input id="name" type="text" />
</form>
```

<callout-info class="aside">
	In React, the `for` attribute is not allowed as a prop, so you use `htmlFor`
	instead.
</callout-info>

The web platform has many good built-in features for accessible elements,
however, in some cases, you will need to use props prefixed as `aria-`. ARIA is
an acronym for "Accessible Rich Internet Applications". It is a set of
attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications more
accessible to people with disabilities. You can
[find the ARIA specification on the w3.org website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/).

It's often said that the first rule of ARIA is "don't use ARIA". This is because
ARIA is a tool of last resort. It is meant to be used when the browser and HTML
alone are not enough to make your web application accessible.

One common example of this is error messages. The web doesn't have a built-in
mechanism for associating error messages to the fields they're reporting on, so
you need to use ARIA to do this.

```html
<form>
	<label for="name">Name</label>
	<input
		id="name"
		type="text"
		aria-invalid="true"
		aria-describedby="name-error"
	/>
	<div id="name-error">Name is required</div>
</form>
```

There is a disappointing gap in the support various screen readers have for ARIA
and other accessibility features. This is why it's important to test your web
application with a screen reader on various platforms. You can use the
[NVDA screen reader](https://www.nvaccess.org/) on Windows, or the
[VoiceOver screen reader](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/) on Mac.

Another important aspect you'll have to work with a lot as a web dev is managing
keyboard focus. For example, when the user navigates to a page, your application
should automatically focus them to the first relevant focusable element on the
page. Or, if the user submits a form and there are errors, your application
should auto-focus to the first field with an error message.

One thing that can help a lot is using libraries that abstract away the
complexities of accessibility for common components you need. In the Epic Stack
for example, we're using a set of React components from
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

## In Remix

Remix has some features that support you in making your application accessible.
For example, Remix will automatically manage scrolling for you as the user
navigates around your application, and if there's a situation where you don't
want to restore scrolling, you have a lot of power to control this on a per-link
or per-page basis. Learn more from
[this Remix Single YouTube video about Scroll Restoration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_H8j3rkpjI).

Also, Remix's support for React enables you to use libraries (like Radix UI)
which do a great job of making common components accessible.

Additionally, nested routes can help with maintaining keyboard focus in many
instances. It is possible that in the future, Remix will add even better support
for this.

<callout-info>
	Because we're dealing with both "reusable components" and "non-reusable" IDs,
	sometimes it can be handy to generate IDs. In React to do this in a way that
	is "safe" for a server render, you'll likely need to use [the `useId`
	hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId).
