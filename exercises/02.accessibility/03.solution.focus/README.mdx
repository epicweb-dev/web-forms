👨‍💼 Great work! This is a much more pleasant form to work with. That code you
wrote looks pretty nice and reusable.

💯 Hmmm... If you have some extra time, try to move the `useEffect` hook into
a reusable `useFocusInvalid` hook. I should be able to use it like this:

```tsx
useFocusInvalid(formRef.current, hasErrors)
```
