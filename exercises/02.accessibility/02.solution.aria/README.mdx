# Validation ARIA attributes

👨‍💼 Super, now screen readers will be able to read out the error messages for
specific fields and it knows which fields are invalid thanks to
`aria-invalid="true"`. But we still need to help the screen reader user (and
non-screen reader users) navigate more efficiently to the field that has an
error, so let's do that next.

<callout-info class="aside">
	Note: Including `aria-invalid="false"` is actually recommended over not
	including it at all. When `aria-invalid="false"` is explicitly provided, it
	ensures that the screen reader conveys to the user that the input is valid,
	which can help in reducing confusion and providing clear feedback. Some screen
	readers might interpret the absence of `aria-invalid` as an indication that
	the validity is unknown and may not provide any specific feedback regarding
	validation errors or validity status. Others might infer the validity based on
	other cues in the document, such as HTML5 validation attributes (required,
	pattern, etc.) or contextual clues, but this behavior isn't guaranteed across
	all screen readers. Screen readers are definitely at the level of consistency
	with one other that browsers were in the early 2000s 😱 so it's a challenge to
	keep up with all the nuances.
