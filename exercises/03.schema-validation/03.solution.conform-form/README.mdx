# Conform form utils

👨‍💼 Stellar! We've not only drastically reduced the amount of code (and
therefore potential for bugs caused by human error as well as maintenance
burden), but we've also improved the user experience by making the form more
progressively enhanced.

Give this a shot:

- Disable JavaScript (using DevTools or go to <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />
  and comment out the `<Scripts />` element there).
- Reload the form page.
- Remove the contents of the "Title" field.
- Try to submit the form and notice the browser's native validation prevents you
  from doing that. We had this already.
- Let's simulate some backend-only validation by adding "novalidate" to the
  `<form>`.
- Now try to submit an invalid form.
- Notice that the error shows up, and the title is still empty!

This should illustrate to you that we've successfully implemented progressive
enhancement for this form. The user won't lose any work in the event the
JavaScript fails to load. This is a very important aspect of accessibility.
Huzzah!
