# Schema Validation

It doesn't take long before you are really tired of writing code that looks like
this:

```tsx
if (title === '') {
	errors.fieldErrors.title.push('Title is required')
}
if (title.length > titleMaxLength) {
	errors.fieldErrors.title.push('Title must be at most 100 characters')
}
if (content === '') {
	errors.fieldErrors.content.push('Content is required')
}
if (content.length > contentMaxLength) {
	errors.fieldErrors.content.push('Content must be at most 10000 characters')
}
```

I'm afraid to say it gets worse.

If you haven't felt the draw to write a utility to improve this yet, you will.
For example, we could do something like this:

```tsx
function validate(value: string, max: number) {
	const errors = []
	if (value === '') {
		errors.push('Required')
	}
	if (value.length > max) {
		errors.push(`Must be at most ${max} characters`)
	}
	return errors
}

errors.fieldErrors.title.push(...validate(title, titleMaxLength))
errors.fieldErrors.content.push(...validate(content, contentMaxLength))
```

Luckily, there are already libraries that do this for us so we don't have to
trouble ourselves with writing our own validation. On top of this, they allow
you to be much more declarative with your validation. The library we'll use
looks like this:

```tsx
z.object({
	title: z.string().max(titleMaxLength),
	content: z.string().max(contentMaxLength),
})
```

This is how you create your schema. And then you use that to perform the
validation (parsing):

```tsx
const result = schema.safeParse({ title, content })

if (result.success) {
	// we're good, check result.data
} else {
	// we're not good, check result.error
}
```

Schema validation is a great way to validate data due to its declarative nature.

## Zod

The library we're going to use is [Zod](https://zod.dev). Zod is a
"TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference" that allows you
to define schemas for your data. A lot of the web ecosystem already uses it and
it has great integrations with other libraries we'll want to use.

And because it has fantastic TypeScript support, it allows us to have a lot more
confidence in our code as the types flow through our application. It's a great
way to manage I/O boundaries to your application like reading from the
filesystem, making HTTP requests, and interacting with databases.

Zod also allows for a great deal of customization and
[refinement](https://zod.dev/?id=refine) in your validation and error messages.
Here are some examples from [the Zod docs](https://zod.dev):

```tsx
z.string().max(5, { message: 'Must be 5 or fewer characters long' })

// even type inference based on the schema:
const A = z.string()
type A = z.infer<typeof A> // string

const name = z.string({
	required_error: 'Name is required',
	invalid_type_error: 'Name must be a string',
})

const user = z.object({
	username: z.string().optional(),
})

const nonEmptyStrings = z.array(z.string()).nonempty({
	message: "Can't be empty!",
})
```

Zod is extremely powerful. I recommend you have the documentation open during
these exercises for reference.

## Conform

One of the benefits to using a declarative interface for validation is that you
can use that same schema to assist in the generation of that data–including for
the forms users will fill out!

While you most definitely _can_ generate the entire form based on the schema if
you want to (I've done this
[before](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly)), we're going to keep our
UI flexibility and just use the schema to give us type safe data to create the
props for our forms.

You may not have thought about it, but often we duplicate our validation logic
between our client and our server. We do it on the server because we have to and
on the client because we want to give the user feedback as they're filling out
the form (for a better UX).

With Zod, we can use the same schema to validate the data on the client _and_
the server. But then, that's just the JavaScript portion. What about the HTML
attributes?

If you have a schema like this:

```tsx
const FormSchema = z.object({
	email: z.string().email(),
})
```

Then you want the form to look like this:

```html
<form method="post">
	<label for="email-input">Email</label>
	<input id="email-input" type="email" required />
</form>
```

And when there's an error, we also want to have the right aria attributes:

```html
<form method="post">
	<label for="email-input">Email</label>
	<input
		id="email-input"
		type="email"
		aria-invalid="true"
		aria-describedby="email-errors"
		required
	/>
	<ul id="email-errors">
		<li>Must be a valid email address</li>
	</ul>
</form>
```

Those attributes are very important (and very intentional). Without those
attributes, the user doesn't get any client-side validation until the JavaScript
finishes loading. Additionally, screen readers will reference these attributes
in their assistance to the user. So these attributes are very important.

Luckily, we can use the schema to generate these attributes for us. We'll use
a library called [conform](https://conform.guide) to do this. Conform is "a
progressive enhancement first form validation library for Remix and React
Router."

Progressive Enhancement is the idea that your application starts with a baseline
functionality, and then you layer on additional functionality as the user's
device and browser support it. Practically speaking, this means that our form
will work before the JavaScript finishes loading (or even if it never does),
and then we use the JavaScript to enhance the experience with better pending UI
and faster transitions.

Conform has an adapter for Zod schemas with utilities that are perfect for what
we're looking for. Here's an example:

```tsx
import { conform, useForm, report } from '@conform-to/react'
import { getFieldsetConstraint, parse } from '@conform-to/zod'
import { Form } from '@remix-run/react'
import { json, redirect } from '@remix-run/node'
import { z } from 'zod'

const LoginSchema = z.object({
	email: z
		.string({ required_error: 'Email is required' })
		.email('Email is invalid'),
	password: z.string({ required_error: 'Password is required' }),
})

export async function action({ request }: DataFunctionArgs) {
	const formData = await request.formData()
	const submission = parse(formData, {
		schema: LoginSchema,
	})

	if (submission.intent !== 'submit') {
		// the user hasn't submitted the form yet
		// this will happen if Conform is validating the form before submission
		// (like if we configure Conform to validate onBlur)
		return json({ status: 'idle', submission: report(submission) } as const)
	}

	if (!submission.value) {
		// there's no value because there is an error in the form
		return json({ status: 'error', submission: report(submission) } as const, {
			status: 400,
		})
	}

	const { email, password } = submission.value

	const isAuthenticated = await authenticate({ email, password })
	if (!isAuthenticated) {
		return json(
			{
				status: 'error',
				submission: report(submission, {
					formError: ['Invalid email or password'],
				}),
			} as const,
			{
				status: 401,
			},
		)
	}

	return redirect('/dashboard')
}

export default function LoginForm() {
	const actionData = useActionData<typeof action>()
	const [form, fields] = useForm({
		id: 'login-form',
		constraint: getFieldsetConstraint(LoginSchema),
		lastSubmission: actionData?.submission,
		onValidate({ formData }) {
			return parse(formData, { schema: LoginSchema })
		},
	})

	return (
		<Form method="post" {...form.props}>
			<div>
				<label htmlFor={fields.email.id}>Email</label>
				<input {...conform.input(fields.email)} />
				<ErrorList id={fields.email.errorId} errors={fields.email.errors} />
			</div>
			<div>
				<label htmlFor={fields.password.id}>Password</label>
				<input
					{...conform.input(fields.password, {
						type: 'password',
					})}
				/>
				<ErrorList
					id={fields.password.errorId}
					errors={fields.password.errors}
				/>
			</div>
			<ErrorList id={fields.password.errorId} errors={form.errors} />
			<button type="submit">Login</button>
		</Form>
	)
}

function ErrorList({
	id,
	errors,
}: {
	id?: string
	errors?: Array<string> | null
}) {
	if (!errors) return null
	errors = Array.isArray(errors) ? errors : [errors]

	return errors.length ? (
		<ul id={id} className="flex flex-col gap-1">
			{errors.map((error, i) => (
				<li key={i} className="text-foreground-danger text-[10px]">
					{error}
				</li>
			))}
		</ul>
	) : null
}
```

There's quite a bit in there, but we'll look through all of it piece by piece in
the exercise.
