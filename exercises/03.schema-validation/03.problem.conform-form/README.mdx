# Conform form utils

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/professional-web-forms/schema-validation/type-safety-with-conform" />

üë®‚Äçüíº The backend is only one piece of this. Now we want to use Conform to help us
build out the form in the UI. We'll use the `@conform/react` package for some
utilities and also a utility from `@conform/zod` to convert our Zod schema into
HTML validation attributes so we can delete those! Once we've done that, we no
longer need to duplicate that validation logic in the UI! It's truly consistent
between the UI and the server!

Here's the relevant bits from the example we had in our background info for this
exercise:

```tsx lines=1-2,18-25,28,30-32,35-40,42
import { conform, useForm } from '@conform-to/react'
import { getFieldsetConstraint, parse } from '@conform-to/zod'
import { Form } from '@remix-run/react'
import { json, redirect } from '@remix-run/node'
import { z } from 'zod'

const LoginSchema = z.object({
	email: z
		.string({ required_error: 'Email is required' })
		.email('Email is invalid'),
	password: z.string({ required_error: 'Password is required' }),
})

// ...

export default function LoginForm() {
	const actionData = useActionData<typeof action>()
	const [form, fields] = useForm({
		id: 'login-form',
		constraint: getFieldsetConstraint(LoginSchema),
		lastSubmission: actionData?.submission,
		onValidate({ formData }) {
			return parse(formData, { schema: LoginSchema })
		},
	})

	return (
		<Form method="post" {...form.props}>
			<div>
				<label htmlFor={fields.email.id}>Email</label>
				<input {...conform.input(fields.email)} />
				<ErrorList id={fields.email.errorId} errors={fields.email.errors} />
			</div>
			<div>
				<label htmlFor={fields.password.id}>Password</label>
				<input {...conform.input(fields.password, { type: 'password' })}>
				<ErrorList
					id={fields.password.errorId}
					errors={fields.password.errors}
				/>
			</div>
			<ErrorList id={fields.password.errorId} errors={form.errors} />
			<button type="submit">Login</button>
		</Form>
	)
}
```

Notice the lack of HTML validation, `name`, `id`, and `aria-` attributes! Oh,
and the lack of `noValidate` on the form as well. All that stuff is handled for
us by Conform and derived from our Zod schema. And it's all typesafe as well. If
we change the schema, we'll get type errors in both our UI and our server code.
And again, it's all progressively enhanced too.

The derived attributes are coming from the `getFieldsetConstraint` utility which
reads our Zod schema and configures the `fields` to have the correct attributes.
Then the `conform.input`, `conform.textarea`, etc. utilities read that config
and apply the correct attributes.

The `lastSubmission` option is used to set the errors as well as the values of
the fields.

And the `onValidate` bit will run our validation on the client. This is awesome
because now the user doesn't need to bother submitting the form before they get
feedback on their input! This has interesting implications for validation that
requires database access. We'll get to that in a bit.

Conform truly is great üèÖ

But we've still gotta implement it first! So let's get to it. Get ready to
remove a lot of code!

Oh, one thing that's not in our example that we'll be using is the
`defaultValue` option. Since we're editing a note, we want the initial values
to be set to the current value in the note. For example:

```tsx lines=8-11
const [form, fields] = useForm({
	id: 'login-form',
	constraint: getFieldsetConstraint(LoginSchema),
	lastSubmission: actionData?.submission,
	onValidate({ formData }) {
		return parse(formData, { schema: LoginSchema })
	},
	defaultValue: {
		email: user.email,
		password: 'lol',
	},
})
```
