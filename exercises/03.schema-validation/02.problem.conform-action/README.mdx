# Conform action utils

👨‍💼 Having to create an object out of `formData` is troublesome. We can actually
call `Object.fromEntries(formData)` and that'll work for our simple case, but
it's pretty limited and doesn't work for nested objects (which we'll get to
later). So let's use Conform's utilities to update our `action` to parse our
`formData` and parse it with Zod for us:

Here's the relevant part of the example from the background info we saw earlier:

```tsx lines=1,15-17,19-25,27-32,34,38-46
import { getFieldsetConstraint, parse } from '@conform-to/zod'
import { Form } from '@remix-run/react'
import { json, redirect } from '@remix-run/node'
import { z } from 'zod'

const LoginSchema = z.object({
	email: z
		.string({ required_error: 'Email is required' })
		.email('Email is invalid'),
	password: z.string({ required_error: 'Password is required' }),
})

export async function action({ request }: DataFunctionArgs) {
	const formData = await request.formData()
	const submission = parse(formData, {
		schema: LoginSchema,
	})

	if (submission.intent !== 'submit') {
		// the user hasn't submitted the form yet
		// this will happen if Conform is validating the form before submission
		// (like if we configure Conform to validate onBlur)
		// We'll not add this yet, we'll get to it later.
		return json({ status: 'idle', submission } as const)
	}

	if (!submission.value) {
		// there's no value because there is an error in the form
		return json({ status: 'error', submission } as const, {
			status: 400,
		})
	}

	const { email, password } = submission.value

	const isAuthenticated = await authenticate({ email, password })
	if (!isAuthenticated) {
		// set the form error:
		submission.error[''] = ['Invalid email or password']
		return json(
			{
				status: 'error',
				submission,
			} as const,
			{ status: 401 },
		)
	}

	return redirect('/dashboard')
}
```

Could you update our form to use this in the `action`? This will require a few
changes in the UI as well because the errors are _slightly_ different and we'll
be passing back a `submission` object instead of just the `errors`.

🦉 I'd like you to check out what the `submission` object looks like in the
network tab or log it to the console. Why do you suppose all that information is
necessary?
