# File Validation

ðŸ¦º I'm not too pleased with the fact that we're just ignoring TypeScript.
Remember:

	TypeScript isn't making your life **worse**. It's just showing you how **bad
	your life already is.**

Currently, users could upload whatever they want to our server and we don't
validate anything at all, so it could lead to pretty broken experiences.

We've already got Zod setup in this form, we just need to add support for the
`imageId`, `file`, and `altText` fields.

To help you with the Zod schema, you may checkout
[the Conform docs on File Uploads](https://conform.guide/file-upload). Here's
a snippet from that example:

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
	profile: z.instanceof(File, { message: 'Profile is required' }),
})
```

In our case, the file is optional since the user may just be updating an
existing file. But we _do_ want to warn the user if they're going to try and
upload a file that's too large, so for our `refine` call, we can just check that
the `file.size` isn't too big.

We'll get to actually _displaying_ errors later on.

<callout-danger>
	If you're trying to submit the form and nothing is happening, it could be an
	error that's preventing the form from submitting. But you'll not see the
	errors until we add those. Until then, you can comment out the `onValidate`
	function to prevent client-side validation and check out errors in the network
	tab.

With that, you should be good to go on this one!
