# Field Lists

👨‍💼 We want users to be able to upload multiple images to the notes. So we're
going to need to adjust our Zod config to allow for an array:

```tsx
const RocketSchema = z.object({})
const RocketsSchema = z.array(RocketSchema)
```

This is easy enough, but remember that Forms don't support arrays. So we need to
reach for Conform's utilities to make this a possibility. Luckily, Conform has
a handy utility called
[`useFieldList`](https://conform.guide/api/react#usefieldlist) which allows you
to represent an array of fields in a Form. Here's the example from the Conform
docs:

```tsx
import { useForm, useFieldList, list } from '@conform-to/react'

/**
 * Consider the schema as follow:
 */
type Schema = {
	items: string[]
}

function Example() {
	const [form, { items }] = useForm<Schema>()
	const itemsList = useFieldList(form.ref, items)

	return (
		<fieldset ref={ref}>
			{itemsList.map((item, index) => (
				<div key={item.key}>
					{/* Setup an input per item */}
					<input name={item.name} />

					{/* Error of each item */}
					<span>{item.error}</span>

					{/* Setup a delete button (Note: It is `items` not `item`) */}
					<button {...list.remove(items.name, { index })}>Delete</button>
				</div>
			))}

			{/* Setup a button that can append a new row with optional default value */}
			<button {...list.insert(items.name, { defaultValue: '' })}>add</button>
		</fieldset>
	)
}
```

You'll notice the `list` utilities in there. We'll get to that in the next step.
For now, just focus on getting the `useFieldList` working for our images.
