# Form Validation

👨‍💼 One cool thing about our users is we can trust them so we don't need to do
validation...

😂 Just kidding. In fact, even if you do trust your users we should be doing
validation. It's about a better user experience!

Here are the requirements:

- `title` is required, maximum length of 100
- `content` is required, maximum length of 10000

You can use native HTML form validation attributes on the `input` and `textarea`
to accomplish this. `required`, and `maxlength` are the attributes
you'll need.
