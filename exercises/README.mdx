👨‍💼 Hello, my name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get
oriented and to give you your assignments for the day. We're going to get a new
project for note taking off the ground. We want people to write Epic Notes 💪

Today, you're going to be working on the Epic Notes app adding key features
and fixing significant bugs in a brand new application. Just as if you had been
hired to work with us today. Throughout the workshop, you'll learn important
foundational skills of web app development including:

1. Validating user input and displaying error messages
2. Fixing Accessibility bugs
3. Using a schema to validate data
4. Uploading files to a server
5. Managing form submissions of complex data structures

It's a big job and there's lots to do, so, let's get started!
